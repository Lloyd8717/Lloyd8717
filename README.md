Hi everyone,

I am passionate about sports, especially ice hockey. I recently decided to finally learn how to code, and I'm currently learning to use Python.

While tutorials are a good starting point to become familiar with coding, I found it important to get hands-on experience by writing and testing my own code.

Iâ€™ve always enjoyed sports management games, such as scouting players, creating teams, and finding hidden gems. Therefore, I started a project analyzing NHL players and learning along the way, including skills like web scraping and regression modeling.

I created this GitHub account to track my progress and stay motivated throughout my journey.
