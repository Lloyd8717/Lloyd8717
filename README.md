Hi everyone,

I am a passianote about sports and ice-hockey specially. I recently decided to finally to learn how to code and am learning to use Python.

Although tutorials are a good start to get familliar, I found it important to get hands on and start to write and test some codes.

I always had fun in sports management game like scouting players, creating a team, finding gems ect...
Therefore, I started a project analyzinhg hockey (NHL players) and learning along the ways such as scrapping or regression model. 

I created this Github account to try to track and to stay motivated through my journey.
