Hi everyone,

I am passionate about sports, especially ice hockey. I recently decided to finally learn how to code, and I'm currently learning to use Python.

I graduated in Finance and started to realize during my studies that Excel is limited. For example, we would have love to know Python while doing my master Thesis.

While tutorials are a good starting point to become familiar with coding, I found it important to get hands-on experience by writing and testing my own code.

Iâ€™ve always enjoyed sports management games, such as scouting players, creating teams, and finding hidden gems. Therefore, I started a project analyzing NHL players and learning along the way, including skills like web scraping and regression modeling.

I created this GitHub account to track my progress and stay motivated throughout my journey. Some analysis may be a bit biased, as I am a Swiss fan of the Pittsburgh Penguins :P.
